# NESS-Reloaded
NESS Anti-Cheat reloaded is a recoded version of the old NESS, developed by MSWS.
This Anti-Cheat aims to block a lot of movement and combat cheats using simple and strong methods.
I'm testing it with Spigot, but i think it will work with other spigot forks.
NESS-Reloaded is OpenSource! It uses the GPL-3.0 so you can do what you want with it, but you have to give me credits.
