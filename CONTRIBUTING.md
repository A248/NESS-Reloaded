# You can help in different ways!
I'm a Java Developer:
If you can develope Java then you can help us fixing errors, bypass, false positives, adding new config options, organizing the code...
Just do a Pull Request, we will check it quickly and we will accept it.
If you want to be an Active Java Developer of this project, after some pull requests, we will give to you the permissions to do commits and pulls.

I'm Just a User
If you are a normal user and you can't develope Java/you don't want to code here then you can report bugs, false positives, bypass, errors in the Github Issues Page or in our Discord Server (https://discord.gg/63JGnay)
